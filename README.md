This repo includes the analysis made for getting and cleaning the data for the final assignament of the course  " Getting and Cleaning Data Course".

The script run_analysis.R have all the steps from getting the data to saving the new tidy data.
The steps are divided in 5:

1. Load and merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
